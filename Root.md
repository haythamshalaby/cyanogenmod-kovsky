# Introduction #

**Root** (or Superuser) is a user account on Linux that has control over everything in the Operating System. If you are familiar with Windows, think of it as the "Administrator" user account.

# Details #

In the case with Android, the root user account is in the form of an app known as _Superuser_ by ChainsDD. Root on Android is mainly used for installing custom ROMs (though technically not necessary), overclocking, exploring the root partitions, etc. Most CyanogenMod ROMs are pre-rooted so there is no need to manually do this.
