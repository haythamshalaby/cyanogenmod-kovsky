## What are all those text mean when I turn on my device? ##

These are simply for diagnostic purposes, you can safely ignore them. The blue text is the bootloader, the white text is the kernel. After that, you get the boot animation.

## Will you include additional languages? ##

Yes we are! Simply submit a request in the official thread or in the issue tracker.

## Will you include <INSERT FEATURE HERE>? ##

Most likely we won't because we want it to be a clean copy (or "port" if you prefer) of CyanogenMod.
