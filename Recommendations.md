There are some nice tweaks you can get from [here](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1908269). If you're planning on using the AROMA version, flashing the old ClockworkMod Recovery version is recommended.

# Launcher #

A lightweight launcher is a good decision when you have a lot of apps installed. The old, preinstalled version of ADW.Launcher tends to lag a bit but the latest version seems to be more compatible with older devices, including Android 1.6. Here are a few other suggestions:

  * **[XPERIA Home](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1557091)** - XPERIA S Home Launcher (Requires Android 2.3+ Gingerbread)
  * **[LauncherPro](http://www.launcherpro.com/)** - Lightweight and Full-Featured Launcher
  * **[Holo Launcher](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1636393)** - Lightweight ICS Themed Launcher
  * **[Zeam Launcher](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=664149)** - Lightweight and Battery Conservative Launcher
  * **[Nemus Launcher](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nemustech.launcher)** - Lightweight Launcher

# CPU #

Install [SetCPU](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=505419) to manage you device's CPU frequencies. Use these profiles for your specific purpose.

| **Profile** | **Minimum (MHz)** | **Maximum (MHz)** | **Governor** |
|:------------|:------------------|:------------------|:-------------|
| Stability   | 19.2              | 528               | ondemand     |
| Performance | 128               | 614.4             | performance  |

# Gallery #

The stock Gallery app is too glitchy for use. Thankfully, there are alternatives:

  * **[QuickPic](http://alensw.com/)** - Gallery with a focus on Functionality

# USB Mount/Auto Mount #

There is a major issue where USB storage menu doesn't launch. Mounting itself is fine. Here are a few apps that will help you workaround this issue:

  * **[Multi Mount](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rafoid.multimountsdcard.widget.free)** - USB Mounter Widget
  * **[Auto Mount](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jrtstudio.automount) - Automatic USB Mounting Switch**

# Torch #

The pre-installed Torch app doesn't work because of some missing kernel code. Use these instead:

  * **[OI Flashlight](http://www.openintents.org/en/flashlight)** - Flashlight Using the Camera LED or LCD Backlight
  * **[Tiny Flashlight + LED](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.devuni.flashlight)** - Multi-Functional Camera LED/LCD Backlight Torch

# Battery #

The battery meter is often broken, and the issue probably won't be fixed. Use these tools to at least make your life easier:

  * **[Battery Monitor Widget](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ccc71.bmw)** - Battery Widget with a more accurate reading
  * **[Battery Calibration](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nema.batterycalibration)** - Recalibrates Battery
